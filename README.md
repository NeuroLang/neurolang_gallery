![voila-gallery-logo](./voila-gallery.svg)

A plugin for [The Littlest JupyterHub (TLJH)](https://tljh.jupyter.org) that installs a [Voilà](https://voila-dashboards/voila) Gallery.

## Install

To deploy a new instance of the gallery as a plugin for The Littlest JupyterHub:

1. Fork the repo: https://github.com/voila-dashboards/tljh-voila-gallery
2. Edit `tljh-voila-gallery/tljh_voila_gallery/gallery.yaml` with your own set of examples
3. Follow [one of the tutorials to install TLJH](https://tljh.jupyter.org/en/latest/#installation)
4. At the step asking for user data, use the following command:

```
#!/bin/bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jupyterhub/the-littlest-jupyterhub/master/bootstrap/bootstrap.py \
 | sudo python3 - \
   --plugin git+https://github.com/<your-username>/tljh-voila-gallery@master#"egg=tljh-voila-gallery&subdirectory=tljh-voila-gallery"
```
5. The install process might take between 5 and 10 minutes to complete.
6. Dependending on the method and cloud provider chosen in Step 1, you will get the public IP of the server, which can be used to access the gallery
